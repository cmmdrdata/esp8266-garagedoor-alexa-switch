Alexa home automation using esp8266 board w/ wifi to control an electric garage-door opener


This sketch will control a mosfet board using alexa. It uses an wemos mini d1 board which is an esp8266 with wifi adapter built in. You can also use a relay for this project if you invert the logic to the mosfet board for the relay (HIGH -> LOW, LOW -> HIGH) and it would work the same.

This code allows you to control a garage door with the Amazon Alexa dot by first discovering the switch and then controlling it with your voice.
